# Custom Progress Indicators

This is my implementation of the [Custom Progress Bars](https://medium.com/@marina.sauca/custom-progress-bars-dc1c1c111751) tutorial by Marina Sauca (thanks Marina!).  
This project uses Swift.

## My Changes
In this exercise, I decided to build the project using UIKit instead of Storyboards.
Additionally, I added a button for users to increment and reset the progress indicators.

## What I learned 
For another project that I’m working on, I need to make gradients that animate along a shape’s path. So this was a great refresher for:
Core Graphics basics 
UIBezierPaths
CAShapeLayers
CALayer
CAShapeLayer
CAGradientLayer
Working with masks
Animating layers using CABasicAnimation
